Linear Regression - is a supervised machine learning algorithm used to predict a continuous value based on the relationship between one or more input variables (independent variables) and an output variable (dependent variable). It assumes that the relationship between the variables is linear.

Logistic Regression - is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. Unlike linear regression, which predicts continuous values, logistic regression is used to predict categorical outcomes
