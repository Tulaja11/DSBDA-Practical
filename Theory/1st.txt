Data Wrangling - is the process of transforming and cleaning raw data into a usable format for analysis, visualization, or machine learning. Raw data often comes with inconsistencies, missing values, or irrelevant information that needs to be corrected before any meaningful insights can be extracted. Data wrangling is an essential step in any data science workflow.

Steps : 
Data Collection
Gathering datasets from sources like Kaggle, UCI, web APIs, or local files (CSV, Excel, JSON).

Data Cleaning
Detect and handle missing values using isnull(), fillna(), or dropna().
Remove or correct inconsistent data entries.

Data Transformation
Normalize or scale numeric data (e.g., min-max scaling).

Data Formatting
Ensure data is structured correctlyâ€”proper data types, column labels, consistent units, etc.

Data Validation
Check that the final dataset is logically consistent and complete.
